CSE 380 Final Project
=====================

Since VolRover has let us all down yet again, I'm rapidly switching tracks to
the precanned project. This is the repo for that project.

The project instructions can be found in canned\_project.pdf. I intend to
implement most of the project...though of course time constraints may apply.


## Prerequisites

libgsl
libGRVY

## Compilation Instructions

Project is currently designed to compile on TACC systems (specifically, stampede) only.

## How to run the code

Also coming soon!
